This page provides additional notes, ideas, and ongoing thoughts related to the project.\n## Some Intuitive Ideas\nIn the context of fabric detection, a sensor must be **robust** in industrial environments while providing **accurate, real-time feedback**. One of the main challenges in fabric detection is that fabric is very soft and easily deforms. As a result, a rigid sensor must offer extremely high spatial resolution and very low latency to detect contact before substantial deformation occurs. (Latency is a critical issue because fabric can deform very quickly under even a small force.)\n\n\nAn intuitive idea that follows from this observation is that if the sensor itself is <span style="color:rgb(150, 0, 0);">**"softer"**</span> than the fabric, the fabric will be less prone to deformation upon contact. This, in turn, allows more time for the system to detect contact while maintaining a small interaction force.\n\nAnother intuitive idea is that, since the sensor is "softer" than the fabric, it will deform more than the fabric during contact, making this deformation <span style="color:rgb(150, 0, 0);">**observable**</span> in the sensor’s output. (In fact, we found that deformation in a soft object is easier to detect and more observable than the applied force itself.)\n\nThe final structure of the sensor follows the above ideas: it\'s soft(with a soft membrane structure) and observe detection via deformation(with an internal optic distance sensor to detect deformation of that soft membrane).\n\n## Fabrication\nThere\'s nothing interesting about the optic distance sensor: it is a standard time-of-flight (ToF) module with a relatively wide field of view (FoV) and relatively high spatial resolution, particularly at short range.\n<figure>\n  <img src="/project/sensor6.jpg">\n  <figcaption>Optic sensor without the cover (I took it off to see how it works)</figcaption>\n</figure>\nThe design of the soft membrane is more interesting: it must be softer than the fabric, yet it should maintain its shape (i.e., remain undeformed) during motion or under disturbances such as wind. After several experiments, I found that a 0.4 mm‑thick silicone gel membrane, formed into cylindrical and hemispherical shapes, is the softest configuration that can still maintain sufficient stiffness and shape stability.\n<figure class="img-row">\n<div class="img-wrap">\n  <img src="/project/sensor1.png" style="width: 30%;">\n  <img src="/project/sensor5.jpg" style="width: 55%;">\n</div>\n  <figcaption>Different structures that I came up with</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class="img-row">\n<div class="img-wrap">\n  <img src="/project/sensor2.png"style="width: 55%;">\n  <img src="/project/sensor4.png"style="width: 30%;">\n</div>\n  <figcaption>Testing different thicknesses & final 3D mold for casting the soft membrane</figcaption>\n</figure>\n'}]};var c=i(8185);function l(){let[e,t]=(0,n.useState)("All"),i=Array.from(new Set(["All",...o.items.flatMap(e=>e.tags||[])])),a="All"===e?o.items:o.items.filter(t=>(t.tags||[]).includes(e));return(0,s.jsxs)(c.A,{title:o.title,children:[(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:"filter-buttons",children:i.map(i=>(0,s.jsx)("button",{className:"filter-btn ".concat(e===i?"active":""),onClick:()=>t(i),children:i},i))}),(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:"projects-grid",children:a.map((e,t)=>(0,s.jsxs)(r(),{href:"/projects/".concat(e.slug),className:"project-card",children:[(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:"card-image",style:{backgroundImage:"url(".concat(e.image,")")}}),(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"card-content",children:[(0,s.jsx)("h3",{children:e.title}),e.tags&&e.tags.length>0&&(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:"project-tags",children:e.tags.map((e,t)=>(0,s.jsx)("span",{className:"tag",children:e},t))})]})]},t))})]})}},8185:(e,t,i)=>{"use strict";i.d(t,{A:()=>n});var s=i(5155);function n(e){let{title:t,children:i}=e;return(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"page-layout",children:[t&&(0,s.jsx)("h1",{className:"page-title",children:t}),(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:"page-content",children:i})]})}}},e=>{e.O(0,[619,441,255,358],()=>e(e.s=429)),_N_E=e.O()}]);
