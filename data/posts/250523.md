excerpt: "A quick update on my thoughts when attending ICRA2025."

There are several direction that I found quite interesting(and seems promising) in terms of theory and applications.
- Haptic sensing technology
- Rehabilitation robot (Exoskeletons): learning? control theory?
    - **Engage with differentresearch communities (not only engineering but also clinical neuroscientific)**

- Learning could be a better solution than contraint algorithm(such as MDP, which is more explanable)?
- Simulation?
