## Overview

This project focuses on developing an **autonomous line‑tracking mobile robot car**. This page presents the design and implementation of of an Arduino Nano–based system that integrates infrared sensors, motor speed control and efficient embedded logic to achieve autonomous navigation. The system detects a white line on a dark surface and navigates the path accurately by adjusting the rotation speed of two DC motors. The robot is capable of making directional turns, stopping, and performing complex maneuvers such as 180° and 360° rotations based on real‑time sensor input.

The 3 primary modules:

- Sensing Unit:
**Infrared reflectance sensors** detect the surface contrast between the white track and the dark background. These sensors provide continuous feedback to the microcontroller for navigation decisions.

- Control Unit
The **Arduino Nano** processes input from the sensors and generates control signals based on predefined logic. This unit determines motor direction and speed using PWM (pulse‑width modulation) signals.

- Actuator Unit
A **motor driver (L293D)** receives PWM signals and direction commands to control the left and right DC motors. It enables bidirectional motor motion and smooth speed regulation.
