10:Tc6a,<p>This project is published on ICRA 2025: <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=11127921">A Highly Robust Contact Sensor for Precise Contact Detection of Fabric</a>(co‑first author). This page provides additional notes, ideas, and ongoing thoughts related to the project.</p>
<h2>Some Intuitive Ideas</h2>
<p>In the context of fabric detection, a sensor must be <strong>robust</strong> in industrial environments while providing <strong>accurate, real-time feedback</strong>. One of the main challenges in fabric detection is that fabric is very soft and easily deforms. As a result, a rigid sensor must offer extremely high spatial resolution and very low latency to detect contact before substantial deformation occurs. (Latency is a critical issue because fabric can deform very quickly under even a small force.)</p>
<p>An intuitive idea that follows from this observation is that if the sensor itself is <span style="color:rgb(150, 0, 0);"><strong>&quot;softer&quot;</strong></span> than the fabric, the fabric will be less prone to deformation upon contact. This, in turn, allows more time for the system to detect contact while maintaining a small interaction force.</p>
<p>Another intuitive idea is that, since the sensor is &quot;softer&quot; than the fabric, it will deform more than the fabric during contact, making this deformation <span style="color:rgb(150, 0, 0);"><strong>observable</strong></span> in the sensor’s output. (In fact, we found that deformation in a soft object is easier to detect and more observable than the applied force itself.)</p>
<p>The final structure of the sensor follows the above ideas: it&#39;s soft(with a soft membrane structure) and observe detection via deformation(with an internal optic distance sensor to detect deformation of that soft membrane).</p>
<h2>Fabrication</h2>
<p>There&#39;s nothing interesting about the optic distance sensor: it is a standard time-of-flight (ToF) module with a relatively wide field of view (FoV) and relatively high spatial resolution, particularly at short range.</p>

The design of the soft membrane is more interesting: it must be softer than the fabric, yet it should maintain its shape (i.e., remain undeformed) during motion or under disturbances such as wind. After several experiments, I found that a 0.4 mm‑thick silicone gel membrane, formed into cylindrical and hemispherical shapes, is the softest configuration that can still maintain sufficient stiffness and shape stability.
