For me, accessibility extends beyond physical disabilities to address language barriers, technical constraints, and cognitive differences. Ideally, I want to create a space where content is easy to understand and interact with, regardless of a user's situation.\n\n# My Rebuild Objectives\n\nPreviously, my scope was limited. I focused primarily on basic visual accessibility, neglecting Assistive Technologies (AT), multi-language support, and visual comfort. This rebuild marks a significant shift in scope. I am moving beyond just \"looking good\" to ensuring the underlying structure works for everyone. My ultimate goal is simple in concept, though complex in implementation: **anyone** who visits this site should be able to perceive and interact with the content equally, regardless of their physical abilities or devices.\n\nWhile universal design is challenging and it's hard to accommodate every single edge case, I am striving for the best possible baseline.

However, my technical goal is now to ensure the core structure of the website is accessible to most people and AT, including screen readers and voice control. Of course, it must also work flawlessly on mobile.\n\n# Usability Checklist and POUR\n\nThe new features I added to support accessibility are listed as follows (following the [WCAG 2.2 guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22)):\n\n1. **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.\n   - **Add accessible names for interactive elements**: Imagine trying to navigate a website with a screen reader with your eyes closed; if buttons only say \"button\", you are stuck; I used [WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools)](https://wave.webaim.org/) to check missing aria labels and ALT text. I ensured all non-text elements (including images, buttons, icons, disclosure widgets) have text labels.\n   - **Use semantic structure instead of visual tricks**: Imagine reading a document where the chapters act just like normal text; The key points are hard to follow. I replaced visual shortcuts (like `\u003Cbr>`tags and bold text) with structural heading tags, and removed confusing animations. This ensures that the structure you see with your eyes is exactly the same structure assistive technology reads to the user.\n   - **Adjust contrast and font for readability**: I used [WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools)](https://wave.webaim.org/) to identify and fix low-contrast elements. Rather than adding a custom font resizer (which might be implemented in the future), I support native browser zooming up to 500%. A good practice is to implemente a constrained layout container (max-width). This allows text to wrap naturally at high magnification without breaking the layout or forcing horizontal scrolling. I also focused on strong defaults: a 20px font size, 1.5 line-height, and a clean sans-serif typography.\n2. **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.\n   - **Bypass repetitive navigation**: Imagine having to press the \"Tab\" key 20 times to slog through a long list of search filters just to read a single article; I implemented a \"Skip to Main Content\" link that appears on the first keystroke, while keeping my original navbar for quick access. This allows keyboard users to jump instantly past repetitive menus and filters to reach the primary content immediately, saving them from physical fatigue and frustration.\n   - **Add link purpose, section heading, page location**: To help users navigate, find content, and determine their current position, I structured the site to build a clear mental model of the layout. I ensured every content section is defined by a descriptive heading. I also replace ambiguous navigation (e.g., \"click here\") with descriptive anchors like \"my logs\".\n     > I am still prototyping a breadcrumb navigation system to provide users with a visual trail of their location within the site hierarchy. For example, the current page is Home > Blogs > Making My Website Accessible. One possible implementation is to trigger breadcrumb navigation when the navbar is hovered or activated.\n\n3. **Understandable**: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.\n   - **Support multi-language contents**: Add `lang` attribute so that screen readers can correctly synthesize speech. However, this mechanism fails if the user lacks the installed voice pack. To ensure robustness, I avoid inline mixing by default. The interface filters content to a single language (English or Chinese), applying specific `lang` attributes to mixed content only when 'Select All' is explicitly triggered.\n   - **Improve content consistency and predictability**: Remove the sticky positioning from the navigation bar to avoid obscuring focused elements. This also improve the tab order logic to eliminate unexpected scroll jumps when moving between the navbar and page content, ensuring a consistent visual context. Use the same style for all links/buttons for consistency.\n   - **Improve input assisstant**: To help users avoid and correct mistakes, I added explicit instructions to the search block and feedback messages when no matching posts are found. A \"Clear All\" button is now dynamically provided when search yields no results, allowing users to easily reset filters.\n\n4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.\n   - **Standardize HTML components**: I replace generic `div` elements with semantic `button` and `a` (for link) tags. This ensures native keyboard accessibility and correct role announcements for assistive technologies.","src/content/blog/a11y-website/index.md","aa6d358b63c4b049",{"html":25,"metadata":26},"\u003Ch1 id=\"why-accessibility-a-shift-of-perspective\">Why Accessibility: A Shift of Perspective\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>I used to treat accessibility only as a checklist.

When a human touches a shirt, we rely on subtle tactile feedback to know exactly where the surface is. The fingers can feel the slightest graze of a fabric surface without disturbing the pile. Robots, on the other hand, usually struggle with this. Most robotic grippers are rigid. When a rigid sensor touches a soft, fluffy sweater, the sweater deforms and compresses long before the sensor registers any force.\n\n> Why is this \"squashing\" a problem?\n\nIt comes down to singulation: the ability to pick up just one item. Imagine a stack of t-shirts. If a robot has to press down to \"feel\" the contact, it compresses the top shirt into the ones below. This pressure increases friction and causes the fabric layers to stick together. So instead of peeling off a single layer, the robot inevitably grabs a clump of multiple items.\n\nThe takaway message is: **the robot must detect the surface before compressing the pile**.\n\n# Intuitive Idea\n\nOne way to achieve this is by pushing hardware limits: using sensors with extremely high spatial resolution and ultra-low latency. However, in an industrial context, building a sensor that is fast, accurate, robust, and affordable is a massive engineering challenge.\n\nSo, consider flipping the condition: If the sensor is designed to be softer than the fabric, the sensor will deform before the fabric does. This mechanical compliance acts as a buffer, giving the system more time to detect the contact event while ensuring the interaction force remains minimal.\n\n> How to sense force in a piece of soft surface?\n\nThis leads to a another intuitive realization: in a soft body, geometric deformation is easier to observe than contact force. So instead of trying to embed complex pressure arrays (which often make the skin stiffer) or measure electrical resistance (which can be noisy), just monitor the shape of the sensor from the inside.\n\nThe final design follows this logic directly:\n\n1. The Interface: A soft silicone membrane that deforms instantly upon contact.\n2. The Observer: An internal Time-of-Flight (ToF) optical sensor that continuously measures the distance to the center of the membrane.\n\nWhen the membrane touches a fabric, it gets pushed inward. The optical sensor detects this tiny reduction in distance, effectively translating a physical deformation into a precise contact signal.\n\n# Design & Fabrication\n\nFor the hardware, the electronics are actually the easy part. The core is a standard Time-of-Flight (ToF) module. It has a relatively wide field of view (FoV) and high spatial resolution, which is perfect for short-range detection.\n\nThe true puzzle is the soft surface itself. It must be softer than the fabric to prevent compression, yet stiff enough to hold its shape against gravity, motion, or air currents. The fun part of engineering is trying things until they work. After iterating through several designs, I found that a 0.4 mm‑thick silicone gel membrane was the winner. When formed into a hemispherical shape, it was the softest configuration that could still maintain its shape stability.\n\n![Different structures I tested](image.png)\n\nA tip for fabricating a soft membrane is to design a proper fixing structure for the 3D mold that holds the mold securely in place. This helps ensure that the membrane maintains a uniform thickness in all directions.\n\n# Algorithm & Testing\n\nThe signal processing is straightforward. I used a standard Kalman Filter to clean the raw sensor data. The logic is simple: a decrease in distance indicates that contact has occurred. The real challenge lies in balancing **accuracy** and **sensitivity**.\n\nIf we simply lower the detection threshold to be more sensitive, the robot starts reacting to the wind (false positives). If we raise the threshold to be more accurate, the robot reacts too late, and the fabric gets squashed. We couldn't solve this trade-off just by tuning software parameters. We needed a better physical indicator.\n\nInstead of just looking at \"how much\" the distance changed, I started looking at \"how\" the membrane deformed. I discovered a non-linear physical behavior that distinguishes real contact from noise. By training the classifier to recognize this specific deformation pattern rather than just a simple distance threshold, we achieved high sensitivity without the false alarms.\n\n[^1]: The official paper, [A Highly Robust Contact Sensor for Precise Contact Detection of Fabric](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=11127921), has been published on ICRA 2025.","src/content/blog/tactile-sensor/index.md",[57],"image.png","0b1c1dbdde3cfb33",{"html":60,"metadata":61},"\u003Ch1 id=\"inspiration\">Inspiration\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>The whole project\n\u003Csup>\u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fn-1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1\u003C/a>\u003C/sup> is based on the following idea: Sorting a pile of laundry is simple for humans, but challenging for robots.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The main issue here is that fabric is elusive.

这是最好的时代，这是最坏的时代。\n\n为一段旅程命名，竟然比行路本身更费心思。此行经上海至北京，但是似乎北京上海之旅是一个太普通的名字。忽然想到“北狩”：史书中帝王被俘的托辞，此刻却成了一个讽刺。所有命名都是精神的碑刻，为记忆赋形而已。于是从北京和上海各取了一个字，权且冠以“北上”。写完全篇才发现无心插柳的妙处：北上也是此行方向。对一个南方孩子来说，北上也是一条带着温度的河流，从厦门终年的暖雾里启程，奔涌向冰雪封疆的国度。\n\n# 第一城：上海\n\n> 这是光明的季节，这是黑暗的季节。\n\n从十几度的厦门降落在接近零度的上海，对枯叶和冰雪这种“冬景”的期待被被刺骨的寒风击碎。一锅港式花雕鸡火锅成了救赎：黄酒的鲜香裹挟着热气翻涌，颠覆了我在香港两年的火锅记忆。或许这般滚烫的鲜美，本就需借几分寒气，才能激发出最好的味道。锅里的汤咕嘟咕嘟翻滚着，拥挤的馆子里热气开的十足，我和半年未见的朋友一边吃，一边聊，也不知过了多久，只觉得身心都暖和起来。\n\n身子暖和了，自然要去街上走走。一月份的上海铺陈着深秋的景致，像我这样常年待在南方的人自然是瞬间被秋日的浪漫俘获：脚下沙沙作响的落叶，满目流淌的金黄，空气中浮动的扑面而来的凉意。但是没一会儿，冷风像针一样钻进衣领，冻得我受不了，只能狼狈地躲到街边小店取暖。就这么漫无目的地逛了半个下午，兴致彻底被冷风吹没了。或许我骨子里早就习惯南方的暖阳了，对北国秋冬的向往，不过一场纸上谈兵的幻想。\n\n直到和朋友汇合，逛街才从在冷风中的挣扎变成了真正的城市探索。最舒服的是随心所欲的松弛：脚步随着目光自然而然地拐进一家家小店。逛逛堆满精巧小动物摆件的日式杂货铺，再看看挂着时髦冬装的时装店。当然也少不了去打卡全球最大的星巴克旗舰店。哪怕冻得够呛，我们还是任性地点了全冰沙的抹茶星冰乐！牙齿冻得直打颤，却笑得肆无忌惮，那点寒意，似乎也在这份放纵里被冲淡了。\n\n![我和朋友的两双鞋与两片落叶的合影](image.png)\n\n> 我们面前拥有一切，我们面前一无所有。\n\n我是彻头彻尾的J人，尤其是在旅行的时候：执着于安排好每一个旅行的瞬间和计划，最好是能在脑海中过一遍所有可能遇到的情况。而我的朋友，仿佛天生拥有在无数可能性中开辟新路的才能。我原本对这种计划外的事情总带着一丝谨慎的疑虑，可体验了几次随心而行、偏离航线后，我开始享受这种令人着迷的松弛滋味。\n\n于是上海的这几天里，我们在人和馆尝到了心心念念的本帮菜；去了热门的景点和打卡地；也少不了骑车逛逛朋友的学校。我们也临时起意地去豫园看灯会；疯狂地在迪士尼看完烟花之后杀回项目玩到闭园广播响起，成为了最后两个离开园区的游客。\n\n当然也有一些意料之外的惊吓：凌晨三点顶着睡意和寒意匆匆下楼，给朋友拿外卖送来的退烧药，这也算是另一种难忘的城市探索了。毕竟，这要是在香港，深更半夜的可没这么容易搞到药。\n\n# 第二城：北京\n\n飞往北京的那天恰逢我的生日。落地北京，我们一起去找阿包庆生：阿包比我小整整一岁，因此这也是她的18岁生日。\n\n![我和阿包的生日蛋糕：祝包子和葫芦生日快乐！](image-1.png)\n\n逛校园自然是必不可少的环节。我们在学校门口和阿包汇合，跟着她骑车在大学里闲逛。眼前豁然铺展开大片大片的绿茵草地，阳光慷慨地洒落，开阔的空间里自由生长着不知名的绿植，和叽叽喳喳的鸟雀。我心底不由得涌起一阵感慨：我那在方寸之间辗转腾挪的母校，何时也能拥有这样一片舒展的天地！\n\n> 人们正在直登天堂；人们正在直下地狱。\n\n北京给我的感觉，与上海截然不同。我最迷恋的北京街头巷尾的那股“烟火气”。这一点，竟和香港有着微妙的相似：那是某种蓬勃的、不加掩饰的生活热情。然而不同的是，北京的底色沉淀于古色古香的建筑之间，显得更为宽广醇厚。\n\n故宫，便是这种磅礴气势的极致体现。红墙白雪，第一眼是美，是典雅，是庄重。但当穿过庄严的前殿步入后宫，那种空旷宏大的叙事转变成了层层叠叠的门与院。宫墙切割出的方寸天空，让我瞬间体味到“一入宫门深似海”的况味。此刻，才恍然懂得“庭院深深”那个“深”字的份量：它远不止于空间的幽闭，更是一种在时间长河中不断累积、固化的结构性制度带给人的无法喘息的压抑。\n\n行走在漫长的宫墙下，我感受到一种奇特的共鸣：封建王朝的绝对权威早已成为历史，留下的，更像是一件件承载着民族智慧与审美精髓的文化遗产。这些红墙、院落、亭台楼阁，本身无疑是极美的。但它们的意义远不止于中华的美学与文化符号。我也清晰地感受到了一种跨越时空的普遍性：无论时代如何变迁，欲望催生结构，结构异化个体，权力滋生孤独。这些人类个体在宏大结构中的挣扎和困境，仿佛在这些沉默的建筑里留下了永恒的回响。\n![故宫的层层叠叠的宫墙和院落](image-2.png)\n\n> 死而复生\n\n旅程的终点，是景山顶上看到的日落。上山的时候，我满心都是没看到雪，只被马路上的冰渣子滑了一跤的遗憾。走到一个亭子，风景不错，能望尽紫禁城，发现这是崇祯皇帝自缢的地方。他在最后时刻想了什么，无人知晓。不过，我们总算没错过北京的日落。我们就望着这座城，看着太阳沉下去。\n\n日落，就是明天的开始。明天又是新的一天！\n\n![景山上的日落](image-3.png)","src/content/blog/beishangyouji/index.md",[57,120,121,122],"image-1.png","image-2.png","image-3.png","0c4203c52af45cd7",{"html":125,"metadata":126},"\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>这是最好的时代，这是最坏的时代。\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>为一段旅程命名，竟然比行路本身更费心思。此行经上海至北京，但是似乎北京上海之旅是一个太普通的名字。忽然想到“北狩”：史书中帝王被俘的托辞，此刻却成了一个讽刺。所有命名都是精神的碑刻，为记忆赋形而已。于是从北京和上海各取了一个字，权且冠以“北上”。写完全篇才发现无心插柳的妙处：北上也是此行方向。对一个南方孩子来说，北上也是一条带着温度的河流，从厦门终年的暖雾里启程，奔涌向冰雪封疆的国度。\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1
